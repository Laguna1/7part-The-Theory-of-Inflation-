                <p class="titul-p-8">
                    Astronomers have found evidence to support the theory of inflation,
                    which explains how the universe expanded so uniformly and so quickly
                    in the instant after the Big Bang 13.8 billion years ago.

                            <span>THE UNIVERSE</span>is just under 14 billion years old.
                            From our position in the Milky Way galaxy, we can observe a
                            sphere that is now about 92 billion light-years across. But
                            there's a mystery. Wherever we look, the universe has an even
                            temperature.
                        </p>

                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <span>NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>The universe is not old enough for
                            light to have traveled the vast distance from one side of the
                            universe to the other, and there has not been enough time for
                            scattered patches of hot and cold to mix into an even
                            temperature.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <span>DISTANT COFFEE</span>At a smaller scale, imagine using a
                            telescope to look a mile in one direction. You see a coffee cup,
                            and from the amount of steam, you can estimate its temperature
                            and how much it has cooled.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                    <div>
                        <p>
                            <span>COFFEE EVERYWHERE</span>Now turn around and look a mile in
                            the other direction. You see a similar coffee cup, at exactly
                            the same temperature. Coincidence? Maybe. But if you see a
                            similar cup in every direction, you might want to look for
                            another explanation.

                        <p>
                            <span>STILL NOT ENOUGH TIME</span>There has not been enough time
                            to carry coffee cups from place to place before they get cold.
                            But if all the coffee cups were somehow filled from a single
                            coffee pot, all at the same time, that might explain their even
                            temperature.

                            <span>INFLATION</span>solves this problem. The theory proposes
                            that, less than a trillionth of a second after the Big Bang, the
                            universe expanded faster than the speed of light. Tiny ripples
                            in the violently expanding energy field eventually grew into the
                            large-scale structures of the universe.

                            <span>FLUCTUATION</span>Astronomers have now detected evidence
                            of these ancient fluctuations in swirls of polarized light in
                            the cosmic background radiation, which is energy left over from
                            the early universe. These are gravitational waves predicted by
                            Einstein.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            <span>EXPANSION</span>Returning to our coffee, imagine a single,
                            central pot expanding faster than light and cooling to an even
                            temperature as it expands. That is something like inflation. And
                            the structure of the universe mirrors the froth and foam of the
                            original pot.
